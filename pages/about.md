## About the Collection

This is a small collection of recipes gathered from the United States, South Korea, China, Turkey, and Mexico. I have lived and traveled to many countries and wanted to share some of my favorite recipes. I am also lactose intoleract and wanted to provide a way to find recipes that may not have dairy or have dairy substitutions. 

This site was generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
